                           When tech meets nature great things can happen. Fungi technologies are the lastest in a series of breakthroughs in environemntaly friendly ventures.

                            The first single use plastic came into production around 40 years ago and since then has been an envrionmental disaster. Deforestation has also laid waste to rainforests during that time.
                            now Fungi offers a way to take over the role and give our planet a break.

                    <p>First, designers debuted leather made from mushrooms. Now you can sit on furniture made from fungi, too. At first glance, the sturdy white stools and beautiful accent tables look like any other piece of furniture, perhaps crafted from wood or marble. But they are far from ordinary. They are made entirely from ingredients much simpler and squishier than you’d think: the mycelium “roots” of mushrooms, agriculture waste, and microorganisms.</p>

                    <p>Yale students made headlines with the discovery of a fungus in Ecuador, Pestalotiopsis microspora, that has the ability to digest and break down polyurethane plastic, even in an air-free (anaerobic) environment—which might even make it effective at the bottom of landfills.</p>
